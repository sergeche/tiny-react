# Tiny, React-inspired JSX components, based on Virtual DOM

A small wrapper for [Virtual DOM](https://github.com/Matt-Esch/virtual-dom) for creating composable components with JSX syntax.

Created for personal needs for using with [Redux](http://redux.js.org) and because I hate super-fat libraries for small projects. Unlike in React, all components *must* be implemented as pure functions (no internal state, no side-effects).

See test for example usage. More docs coming soon (maybe).
